About the Dataset

The agency created a data set to analyse the costs of advertising in various channels such as radio, television and newspapers and the impact of these advertisements on sales. This data set includes the channel through which each advertising campaign was disseminated and the resulting sales revenue. The agency was asked to analyse this data set to understand the impact of advertising campaigns on overall sales and to develop more effective advertising strategies for its clients.
